This is a reproduction of the SwinIR brain MRI image super-resolution reconstruction task using MMEditing. Below is a brief user guide: First, the `datasets` folder contains some MRI DICOM folders and pre-processed test and train folders. The `check` text file helps you convert DICOM files to usable PNG files. The `check` file helps you process the original images to obtain 2x and 4x LR. The `divide` file can split a dataset into test and training datasets.
Regarding training, you can find the `train` file in the `tools` folder. If you need to modify the parameters, you can find the configuration file in the `my config` folder. The trained model will be saved in the `work dirs` folder.
Regarding testing, you can find the `restoration demo` file in the `demo` folder. Simply modify the test dataset path and model path.
